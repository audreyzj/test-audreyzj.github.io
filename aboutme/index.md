<p style="margin-top: 10px;">
I am <b>Audrey, Jing Zhang, 張靜 (Chinese name)</b>, currently living in Hong Kong. I have a Masters degree in 'Computer Science' from The University of Hong Kong (Hong Kong), a Bachelors degree in 'Software Engineering' from Northwestern Polytechnical University (Xi'an, China) and have been programming / coding / developing R&D software applications, business management systems (both for work) and fun stuff (pet projects and other stuff for game and learning, etc) for more than 2 years. 
<br/><br/>

I  have always been fascinated with science & technology and am curious about many creative things. I am also fascinated by different cultures and like to travel, experience difference fields and understand the world in a better way. 
I want to use this website to capture/archive some of my ideas and thoughts, to share that with others.
<br/><br/>

When I am not working, I am either reading up different stuff, painting etc. or traveling or binge-watching TV shows on streaming services.
